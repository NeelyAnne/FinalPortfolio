                <p>
                    Welcome to my page! I was born in Augusta, Georgia and lived in Waynesboro, Georgia for the first 18
                years of my life.
                My home county has a total of nine stoplights so you could say it's pretty small. After highschool I
                moved to Athens to attend the University of Georgia.
                While at UGA, I was part of many on campus organizations such as Delta Zeta, American Medical Studen
                Association and UGA miracle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I received my Bachelor of Science in general biology in the spring of 2019 and have recently moved to
                Atlanta to attend a coding bottcamo hosted by the Georgia Institute of Technology.
                After this bootcamp is over, I plan to pursue a job in the development world in some aspect. I'm excited
                to see where this path takes me!
